# Slido_Cms_Plugin

Slido is a wordpress plugin that can be used to create a beautiful sliding gallery of images to show in the worpress webpage. It plays all the images one by one in a slideshow with sliding animations. There are also left and right buttons for navigating through the images.

The images to be displayed can be uploaded to the wordpress media library. Then simply put the urls of the uploaded images in the shortcode provided. To create the slider on any part of the page, simply create a new block of shortcode anywhere you want to display the Slido and insert the custom shortcode there. The Slido will be automatically added to the preview of the page.
